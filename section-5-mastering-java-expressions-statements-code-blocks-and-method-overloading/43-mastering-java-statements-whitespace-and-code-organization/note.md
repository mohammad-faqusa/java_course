## statements

```java
int myVariable = 50;
```

we have learnt that myVariable = 50 is expression

but where is the statement

the statement is the entire line

```java
        myVariable++;
        myVariable--;
```

whitht semicolon ';', it makes these expressions as statements

```java
        System.out.println("This is a test"); // the print command is also statement

        System.out.println("This is" +
                " another" +
                " still more"); // the three lines are 1 statement
```

```java
        int anotherVariable=50;myVariable--;System.out.println("myVariable = " + myVariable); // three statements with three semicolons

```
