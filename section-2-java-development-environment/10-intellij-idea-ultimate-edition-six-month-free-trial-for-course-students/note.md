# IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition: Six-Month Free Trial for Course Students

## Instructions for a Six-Month Free Trial of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate

This page provides details on how you can access a free, six-month trial of the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate software package, which can be used in this programming course.

The **Ultimate Edition** is the premium version of JetBrains’ programming tool and includes advanced features and capabilities not available in the **Community Edition** (the free version).

The course videos in this section demonstrate how to download and install the **Community Edition,** and you are welcome to use that version if you prefer. However, JetBrains has generously allowed me to offer all students in this course a free six-month trial of their **Ultimate Edition** . I am providing this option to enhance your learning experience.

## **Why Try the Ultimate Edition?**

In my opinion, taking advantage of this trial is highly beneficial. It’s completely free and allows you to experience the full range of **professional features available in the Ultimate Edition** . After the trial, you can either return to using the Community Edition or choose to purchase the Ultimate Edition if you find it valuable.

_Please note:_

I do not receive any commission or payment from JetBrains if you choose to purchase the Ultimate Edition. This offer is purely to give you access to a professional-grade tool for an extended period during your time studying in this course and is offered by the great people at Jetbrains.com.

### Complete instructions for obtaining the trial are included in a document attached to this lecture, titled:

“IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 6-Month Trial.”

Download and follow the steps in the document to activate your trial. Installation is very similar to what is shown in the community edition of IntelliJ videos in this section, so follow along with these videos as they steps are mostly the same.

**important Reminder:**

Please do not share this document with anyone outside this course. JetBrains has provided this offer in good faith, exclusively for my students. They may cancel the trial, or stop others from accessing it, if they see that its been shared on the internet.

Enjoy your trial and happy coding!
